  "While we are here to help you match your outfits like a boss, we want to make it clear that this website is for those people who want to look stylish and put together without sacrificing comfort or individuality. \n\nThis website isn't for you if you fall into one of the following categories: \n\n  1. You're a person who wears shorts and slippers to the office. We love a good pair of crocs as much as the next person, but let's keep the fashion-forward looks to the streets, okay? \n\n 2. You're a fan of Voldemort's wardrobe choices (all-black everything and a creepy snake on the arm). We're all for dark and mysterious, but Voldemort's style is just too dark and mysterious for us.";

  "Welcome to our website! We understand that getting dressed in the morning can be a real struggle, especially when you're trying to coordinate your outfit like Batman trying to match his cape with his cowl. Sometimes it feels like you're playing a game of \"Outfit Roulette\". We also understand that sometimes, even with the best intentions, fashion faux pas can happen.  But don't worry, we've got your back. \n\n Our website is designed to help you put together the perfect look, whether you're going for a casual, everyday look or a more formal, dressed-up style. But let's be real, matching your clothes is only half the battle.  The real key to pulling off an outfit is confidence. But just like Batman and Agnes, you too can pull off any look with the right attitude and a sense of humor. \n\n Lastly, we want to remind you that fashion is all about having fun and expressing yourself. So, don't take it too seriously and don't be afraid to be bold and try something new. With that said, have fun and happy matching!";

  "1. Greetings fashionista! First things first, we need to know if you're dressing up as Agnes or Batman. Choose wisely, as this will determine the level of awesomeness of your outfit.\n\n 2.  After you've made your gender selection, you'll be directed to different pages for headwear, outfit, footwear, and occasion. Here, you'll have the power to select what you want to wear on your head, body, and feet. Just don't choose something too crazy, we don't want any fashion emergencies!\n\n 3. Feeling daring? Go ahead and specify the combination you want and let our AI model determine if it's a match made in fashion heaven. Or, you can simply tell us what you have and ask for suggestions on the rest. Just keep in mind, our AI model is a work in progress, so it might make a few missteps along the way.\n\n 4. If you're feeling lazy or uninspired, you can always hit the \"Need Suggestion\" button. Our model will whip up some suggestions for you after you have gone through all the pages. \n\n 5. Want a t-shirt suggestion? No problem! Just mention \"t-shirt\" in the outfit section and select \"Need Suggestion\". Our AI model will do the rest. Just don't be surprised if it suggests a t-shirt with a picture of a cat, our model has a thing for cats.\n\n 6. Don't worry if you don't know what to wear for every category, you can have empty fields. But, just make sure you don't leave all the fields empty, otherwise our AI model won't have anything to work with.\n\n 7. And now for the nerdy part: Our AI model is brought to you by OpenAI! Yes, that's right, the same folks who created Chat GPT. We're using an existing API key, but keep in mind that this key might get exhausted in the future. If that happens, don't panic! You can get your own OpenAI API key for free and update it in the Config section of the Menu.\n\n 8. And if you're looking for more entertaining results, try playing with the Temperature field. Values between 0 and 1 control how crazy our AI model can be with its predictions. The closer to 0 you go, the more risks it will take. This means it might produce completely different predictions for the same combination, so have fun and see what works for you! The default value is 0.75, so feel free to adjust as you see fit. \n\n\n In conclusion, have fun and be creative with your fashion choices! Our model is here to help, but it's still learning, so be prepared for some unexpected and sometimes hilarious results.";
