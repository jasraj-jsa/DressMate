# Dress Mate
### A virtual wardrobe assistant that helps you match your outfits like a pro with personalized outfit suggestions. 
<br/>

**Note:** Please be aware that the [Dress Mate](https://dress-mate.onrender.com/) website might require approximately 30 seconds to fully load, and there could be some slight delays in rendering its elements. This is primarily attributed to the website's utilization of numerous 3D models and assets. Additionally, the website is hosted on a free-tier version of the hosting platform (Render), which could contribute to the loading time. We are working on fixing that.

## About
We understand that getting dressed in the morning can be a real struggle, especially when you're trying to coordinate your outfit like Batman trying to match his cape with his cowl. Sometimes it feels like you're playing a game of "Outfit Roulette". We also understand that sometimes, even with the best intentions, fashion faux pas can happen. But don't worry, we've got your back.

Our website is designed to help you put together the perfect look, whether you're going for a casual, everyday look or a more formal, dressed-up style. But let's be real, matching your clothes is only half the battle. The real key to pulling off an outfit is confidence. But just like Batman and Agnes, you too can pull off any look with the right attitude and a sense of humor.

Lastly, we want to remind you that fashion is all about having fun and expressing yourself. So, don't take it too seriously, and don't be afraid to be bold and try something new. With that said, have fun and happy matching!
