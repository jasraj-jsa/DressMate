  "While we are here to help you match your outfits like a boss, we want to make a few things clear: \n\n First and foremost, If you're a person who wears shorts and slippers to the office, this website might not be for you. We love a good pair of crocs as much as the next person, but let's keep the fashion-forward looks to the streets, okay? We're all for comfort, but there's a time and place for everything. \n\n Secondly, if you're a fan of Voldemort's wardrobe choices (all-black everything and a creepy snake on the arm), we're sorry to say this website definitely isn't for you. We're all for dark and mysterious, but Voldemort's style is just too dark and mysterious for us. \n\n\n So, in short, this website is for those who want to look stylish and put together without sacrificing comfort or individuality. If that sounds like you, then welcome aboard! We can't wait to help you step up your fashion game.\n\n Lastly, we want to remind you that fashion is all about having fun and expressing yourself. So, don't take it too seriously and don't be afraid to be bold and try something new. With that said, have fun and happy matching!";

  "Welcome to our website! We understand that getting dressed in the morning can be a real struggle, especially when you're trying to coordinate your outfit like Batman trying to match his cape with his cowl.

But don't worry, we've got your back. \n\n Our website is designed to help you put together the perfect look, whether you're going for a casual, everyday look or a more formal, dressed-up style. But let's be real, matching your clothes is only half the battle.  The real key to pulling off an outfit is confidence. But just like Batman and Agnes, you too can pull off any look with the right attitude and a sense of humor. \n\n\n So, come on in and start matching your outfits like a pro. Remember, with the right clothes and the right attitude, you can take on the world!";
